# Release Notes
This update foruses on cleaning up the Project by fially using automatisation to download most modrinth mods needed for Super Visual. Also we switched to Quilt as it seems the more practical platform as it is backwards compatible with fabric for the most part but also offers many unique mods.  
Appart form the internal restructuring, we added a few new mods and textures to better fit Super Visual.

## Info
CEM and xali's Potions is not officially supported for 1.20.1, but they seem to work fine in my testing. If you encounter any issues, please create a issue on GitHub or let us know on Discord.
