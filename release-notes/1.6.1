This is a minor release that mostly consists of a few small mod being added and some settings changes mostly for key-binds, better compatibility and QOL.  
`v` is now talk  
`ctrl` + `v` is now plasmo voice settings  
`ctrl` + `n` is now for minimap settings  
`ctrl` + `y` is now YDM's weapon master settings

## Info
CEM, Essential and xali's Potions is not officially supported for 1.20.1, but they seem to work fine in my testing. If you encounter any issues, please create a issue on GitHub or let us know on Discord.  
Swithed Physics Pro to Normal Physics Mod version since the Pro version has quite some bugs and some configurations are missing  
Enhanced Block Entities should run fine. But please report any missing textures if you find them  

## Known Issues
Essential World Hosting feature might not work.  
Essential doesn't show up in Mod Menu
